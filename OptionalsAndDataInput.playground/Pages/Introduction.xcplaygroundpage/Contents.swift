 # Optionals and Data Input

 By now you are familiar with these data types:
 
 * String
    * e.g.: text, such as "Hello world" or "Pineapple on pizza is delicious!"
 * Int
    * e.g.: a number that is not a fraction; a whole number such as: ...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2...
 * Double
    * e.g.: a number that may be a fractional value; a real number, such as: 3.14159...
 * Bool
    * e.g.: a value that is either `true` or `false`
 
 Today, you will examine what happens when users provide input to a program in the form of a string, and how conversions to other data types are handled.
